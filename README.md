# RoleBasedSystemAssignmentAntarticaGlobal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

## Folder Structure

The app and code structure of the mostly follows the best practice recommendations in the official Angular Style Guide, with a few of my own tweaks here and there.

Each feature has it's own folder (home, login & add-role), other shared/common code such as services, models, helpers etc are placed in folders prefixed with an underscore _ to easily differentiate them and group them together at the top of the folder structure.

Here are the main project files that contain the application logic, I left out some files that were generated by the Angular CLI ng new command that I didn't change.
